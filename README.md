# Tasky

Tasky is a web application designed to assist your volatile memory.

Everyone at some point has wondered: How many times did I take a dump this week? or Did I drink water today?

Why even bother memorizing how many times you shit when you can't even get linear algebra right.

Stop counting like an idiot, use Tasky.
