BIG BUTTON
Everyone at some point has wondered: How many times did I take a dump this week? or Did I drink water today?
Big button is a web application designed to assist your volatile memory.
Why even bother memorizing how many times you do mundane tasks when you can't even get linear algebra right.
Stop counting like an idiot, use Big button.
