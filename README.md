# This is tasky

And my CS50x final project. It was an amazing experience, and even took part in my decision to study computer science.

Tasky is a web application designed to assist your memory.

It will help you count the amount of times you do certain activities like drinking water, counting stars, counting how many red cars pass by. You name it!
