# This is tasky

Have you wondered how many times you drink water every day or if you've taken your daily vitamins?

Tasky is a web application designed to assist you.

It will help you count the amount of times you do certain activities like drinking water, taking your pills, counting how many red cars pass by. You name it!

Basically, how it works is: You register, you create as many buttons as you want and you click them as you count.

You have the option to set the button to reset the count automatically in a given amount of days, weeks, months or years.

Or you can choose the manual reset option when creating a new button and just reset the count yourself.

When you don't want a button anymore you can just hover over the "Resets every x days, weeks..." or "Manual reset" text below it and a remove button will appear, as well as a reset button.

You also have other options on the account tab at the top, where you can reset all counts on your buttons, delete all of your buttons, change your password, or delete your account.

It's already up on heroku and of course it's free to use, so give it a try!
